A data-driven personal website
======
With over four years of experience in Machine Learning (ML), AI and Data Science, I have developed a strong expertise in predictive modelling, deep learning and natural language processing (NLP). I have built my career in various roles and industries, including recent success as Data Scientist at the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in London. During this time, I have led ML model development and NLP-based classifiers, to media analytics, where I developed forecasting models and real-time business intelligence dashboards. I am not only used to wearing many hats but also sincerely enjoy it; I thrive in an environment where no two
days are the same.

A snapshot of my highlights includes:

 Enhanced statistical reliability by developing Python-based anomaly detection and trend analysis scripts, reducing errors in high-volume datasets.

 Built and optimised NLP models using SpaCy, entity recognition and text preprocessing, transforming free-text job skills data into structured insights for workforce analytics.

 Designed a cloud-based Apache Spark solution in GCP, automating large-scale data ingestion and processing, improving efficiency and ensuring high data integrity for statistical reporting.

 Developed predictive models for time-series forecasting and algorithmic trading, leveraging ARIMA, gradient boosting and deep learning techniques.

 Implemented ETL pipelines and big data workflows using Apache Airflow and PySpark, improving real-time data processing capabilities.
