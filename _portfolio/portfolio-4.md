# Exploring Research Methods and Professional Practice

When I began the MSc in Data Science at the University of Essex, I expected to spend most of my time buried in algorithms, code, and datasets. What surprised me most about the Exploring Research Methods and Professional Practice module was that it shifted my attention away from code and forced me to think carefully about how I approach research and why my methods matter. This module has been less about implementing techniques and more about developing the intellectual maturity and professional responsibility that underpin rigorous data-driven inquiry. In the following sections, I reflect on the key aspects of the module and how each has influenced both my academic practice and my view of professional work as a data scientist.
