When I began the MSc in Data Science at the University of Essex, I expected my time to be dominated by algorithms, coding, and working with large datasets. What surprised me most about the Exploring Research Methods and Professional Practice module was how it shifted my focus away from purely technical tasks and encouraged me to think more deeply about the purpose and design of research. Rather than being solely about implementing techniques, the module emphasized developing intellectual maturity, critical thinking, and professional responsibility—qualities that are essential for rigorous, meaningful data-driven inquiry.

This module challenged me to consider not just what I do as a researcher, but why I do it and how my methods impact the credibility and applicability of my work. It has encouraged me to engage more thoughtfully with research design, data ethics, and the communication of findings, helping me see the broader context in which data science operates. In the following sections, I reflect on the key aspects of the module and how each has shaped both my academic practice and my understanding of professional responsibilities as a data scientist, from methodological rigour to ethical stewardship and effective communication.
