Although my primary focus has been on quantitative methods, exploring qualitative analysis techniques added depth to my understanding of research. Learning how to interpret interviews and narrative data made me more aware of the human and contextual dimensions that are often missing from purely numerical work. This perspective has helped me appreciate the value of combining different approaches to capture a more complete picture of a problem.

Visualization techniques also proved to be a powerful tool for making data more accessible. For example, I incorporated confusion matrices and heatmaps into my proposal to provide a clear, visual summary of the model’s performance. These tools not only assisted me in interpreting complex outputs but also made my findings more understandable for stakeholders without a technical background. This experience reinforced the importance of presenting data in ways that are both accurate and communicable, bridging the gap between technical analysis and practical application.
