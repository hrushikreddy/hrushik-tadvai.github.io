Although my primary focus was quantitative, understanding how to analyze qualitative data added depth to my research capabilities. It made me more aware of the narrative and contextual elements often accompanying purely numerical data.

Visualization techniques were especially helpful in making data more accessible. In the proposal, I included performance visualizations—such as confusion matrices and heatmaps—to provide a user-friendly summary of the model's outputs, making the technical findings more digestible for non-technical stakeholders. Research Writing and Presentation

This course changed the way I communicated in my academic facilities. Writing the research proposal required clarity in writing and effective visual and oral presentation. The tutor feedback that I received was the key to improving the structure, coherence, and conciseness.

A personal mode of growth was articulating involuted statistical and technical concepts in a generally understandable language. This skill was particularly crucial during the final proposal presentation when I needed to deliver both the technical depth of my research and its practical implications. In the upcoming presentations, I will try to be more engaging by utilizing example-based storytelling, which I expect will positively impact the audience.
