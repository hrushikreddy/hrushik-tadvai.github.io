This unit deepened my understanding of research designs and methodologies, including exploratory, descriptive, and conclusive research. I recognised early on that my project required a conclusive and quantitative approach, as I needed to evaluate the performance of deep learning models using statistical metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score. This involved designing a controlled study that could yield measurable and reproducible outcomes.

While considering mixed-method approaches, I ultimately decided that the study’s goals aligned more closely with quantitative methodologies. The decision was guided by the desire to ensure scalability and objectivity in evaluating model performance. Learning about the nuances of methodological selection was vital, as it made me more confident in aligning tools and techniques with research goals.

Even though my research was mainly focused on numbers, the awareness of qualitative techniques for data collection — such as case studies, focus groups, and observations — was invaluable. It gave me an appreciation for the experiential and contextual dimensions of research, and how qualitative insights can enrich interpretation.

For instance, when I worked with plant image datasets, I noticed that identical models might perform differently depending on light conditions, environmental circumstances, or geographical locations. Qualitative approaches, such as observational studies or group discussions with horticultural specialists, could shed light on these contextual factors. While I did not directly apply these methods in this project, I now see them as complementary tools that could broaden the scope of future research.
