This unit deepened my understanding of research designs and methodologies, including exploratory, descriptive, and conclusive research. I recognized early on that my project required a conclusive and quantitative approach, as I needed to evaluate the performance of deep learning models using statistical metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score. This involved designing a controlled study that could yield measurable and reproducible outcomes.

While considering mixed-method approaches, I ultimately decided that the study's goals aligned more closely with quantitative methodologies. The decision was guided by the desire to ensure scalability and objectivity in evaluating model performance. Learning about the nuances of methodological selection was vital, as it made me more confident in aligning tools and techniques with research goals. Case Studies, Focus Groups, and Observations Even though my research was mainly focused on numbers, the awareness of qualitative techniques for data collection, such as case studies, focus groups, and observations, was nevertheless a benefit. Mastery of these tools provided additional and main notions about the experiential user and external factors and a reference for different interpretations of the data.

In fact, when I worked with plant image datasets, I experienced that the identical model might perform differently based on certain light conditions, environmental circumstances, or geographical places. Research like observational studies or group discussions with horticultural specialists could help obtain such conclusions; however, these methods were not directly used in this project.
