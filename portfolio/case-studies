# Unit 4 Case Studies, Focus Groups and Observations

In this unit, I explored several qualitative data-collection methods—case studies, focus groups, and observations—as well as how some of these approaches extend into quantitative research. This week helped me understand the practical strengths and limitations of each method and how they can support different types of investigations.

## Case Studies
I learned that case studies involve in-depth exploration of an individual, group, or situation. While they are useful for generating hypotheses and gaining rich contextual understanding, they cannot reliably determine cause and effect. Bias, atypical cases, and weak generalisability limit their predictive power. My key takeaway was that case studies are best used for exploratory insight rather than broad generalisation.

## Focus Groups
Focus groups provided insight into collective perspectives and shared experiences. I reflected on the importance of selecting participants with similar backgrounds or relevant experiences to ensure meaningful discussion. The format is well-suited to understanding “why,” “what,” and “how” questions. I also noted that although focus groups are qualitative, they can support mixed-methods research depending on how responses are analysed.

## Quantitative Observation
This method emphasises the collection of measurable, numerical data through surveys or controlled experiments. I reflected on how quantitative observations can provide objective results that are ideal for statistical analysis. These methods align well with structured research questions that require quantifiable evidence.

## Qualitative Observation
Qualitative observation focuses on natural behaviours and characteristics, often without researcher interference. I learned about different researcher roles—from complete observer to full participant—and how each choice can affect data quality and ethical considerations. Observing people in real-world environments can reveal patterns not easily captured through structured questioning.

## Overall Reflection
This unit strengthened my understanding of when and why to use each method. I gained clarity on how qualitative approaches can complement quantitative analysis, especially in complex investigations. Moving forward, I will consider combining methods where appropriate to enrich the depth and reliability of my research.
