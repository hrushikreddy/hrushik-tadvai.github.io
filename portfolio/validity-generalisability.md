Grasping the concepts of validity, reliability, and generalisability was a turning point in shaping my research approach. These principles ensure that findings are not only accurate but also meaningful and applicable beyond the immediate dataset. This is particularly important in artificial intelligence research, where models can easily overfit or fail to transfer effectively to new contexts. Understanding these concepts has helped me view my work through a lens of rigor and practical relevance.

In refining my proposal, I incorporated cross-validation and other robustness checks to enhance the generalisability of my results. I also planned additional testing across diverse plant species and environmental conditions to ensure that the model performs reliably under varied real-world scenarios. This deliberate attention to reliability and generalisability has strengthened the overall design of my research and increased my confidence in its potential broader impact.
