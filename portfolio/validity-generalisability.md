Grasping the concepts of validity, reliability, and generalisability was a pivotal moment in shaping my research approach. These principles are fundamental to ensuring that findings are not only accurate but also meaningful and applicable beyond the immediate dataset. This understanding is particularly crucial in artificial intelligence research, where models are prone to overfitting or may fail to transfer effectively to new contexts. By integrating these concepts into my thinking, I have learned to evaluate my work not just on technical performance but also on its robustness, relevance, and potential for real-world application.

In refining my research proposal, I incorporated cross-validation and other robustness checks to strengthen the generalisability of my results. I also planned additional testing across diverse plant species and environmental conditions to ensure that the model performs reliably under a range of real-world scenarios. These steps were guided by a commitment to methodological rigour and practical applicability, helping me anticipate challenges and limitations before they arise. Focusing deliberately on reliability and generalisability has not only enhanced the overall design of my research but also increased my confidence in its broader impact, reinforcing the importance of producing work that is both scientifically robust and practically valuable.
