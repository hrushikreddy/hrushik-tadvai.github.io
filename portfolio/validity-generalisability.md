Grasping the ideas of validity, reliability, and generalizability was a determining factor. These precepts guarantee that the research results are right and can be extended to a wider situation. This is of great importance, especially in artificial intelligence research, where the model may not perform well in actual situations due to overfitting or a lack of training data from other scenarios.

While fine-tuning my research proposal, I specifically utilized cross-validation and other techniques to increase model generalizability. In addition, I intended to carry out one more type of testing across a variety of plants and environmental conditions to certify the model's robustness.
