The module’s emphasis on qualitative tools such as interviews, focus groups, and surveys sparked new ideas for scaling my project beyond its initial scope. These methods highlighted the value of gathering nuanced, first-hand perspectives that quantitative data alone might overlook. If the research were to evolve into a larger operation, actively engaging with farmers, agronomists, and other key stakeholders through structured interviews and participatory discussions could provide critical insights into their daily practices, challenges, and expectations. This approach would not only enhance the usability of the model but also ensure that its design aligns with the practical realities of agricultural work, thereby increasing its likelihood of adoption and long-term impact.

Equally, the module reinforced the importance of ethical considerations in every stage of data collection, especially when working with user-generated content. Concepts such as informed consent, transparency, data protection, and the responsible handling of sensitive information were explored in detail, underlining their centrality to trustworthy research. These principles have equipped me to approach future survey design with both methodological rigour and respect for participants’ autonomy and privacy. By embedding ethical safeguards into the research process—such as clear consent procedures, anonymisation of responses, and secure data storage—I can build greater credibility in my work and foster trust among participants.

Together, these learnings from the module have shaped not only how I plan to collect and analyse data but also how I envision the broader social responsibility of my project.
