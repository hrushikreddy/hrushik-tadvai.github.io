The module’s focus on qualitative tools such as interviews, focus groups, and surveys opened new possibilities for expanding my project. These methods highlighted the importance of gathering detailed, first-hand perspectives that quantitative data alone might miss. If the research were to develop into a larger initiative, engaging directly with farmers, agronomists, and other stakeholders through structured interviews and participatory discussions could provide valuable insights into their practices, challenges, and needs. This approach would help ensure that the model remains practical, relevant, and responsive to real-world agricultural contexts, increasing its potential impact and adoption.

The module also reinforced the importance of ethical considerations in data collection, particularly when working with user-generated content. Learning about informed consent, transparency, data protection, and responsible handling of sensitive information has prepared me to design future surveys and interviews with both rigour and respect for participants. By incorporating ethical practices such as clear consent procedures, anonymisation of responses, and secure data storage, I can build trust with participants and ensure the integrity of the research process.

Overall, the module has shaped my understanding of how to combine methodological rigour with ethical responsibility, demonstrating that thoughtful engagement with participants is essential to producing research that is both reliable and socially responsible.
