The culmination of this module was the reflection on professional Development. Tools such as the skills matrix and SWOT analysis helped me evaluate my competencies and identify areas for improvement. I recognized my critical thinking and data analysis strengths but noted areas such as time management and public speaking that required focused development.

I established structured routines to address these gaps and sought feedback proactively. This proactive mindset has already influenced how I conduct myself in professional environments. By aligning academic learning with career aspirations, I see a more straightforward path forward in research and technology-driven roles. Project Management

The last unit was about using project management principles in research. At this point, I learned the importance of frameworks such as Scrum and Kanban, which can increase efficiency and adaptability. Although my ongoing project is individual, I have organized it following agile principles such as defining sprints, setting deliverables, and monitoring using Gant charts.

A six-month research plan, including milestones and contingency planning, was essential for the proposal's feasibility. Applying these principles made the project easier and more aligned with industry-standard practices.
