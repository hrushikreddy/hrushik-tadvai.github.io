The culmination of the module emphasized professional growth and self-reflection. Activities such as the skills matrix and SWOT analysis prompted me to critically evaluate my competencies, helping me to identify both strengths and areas for development. I recognised strengths in analytical thinking, technical execution, and problem-solving, which have supported my confidence in research and data-driven work. At the same time, I became aware of areas needing improvement, including time management, prioritisation, and public speaking, which are essential for effectively translating skills into tangible outcomes.

In response to these insights, I have begun implementing structured routines to manage my time more efficiently, breaking projects into manageable tasks and setting realistic deadlines. I have also actively sought feedback to refine my communication skills, including practice presentations and discussions with peers and mentors. These changes have already influenced the way I engage in both academic and professional contexts, allowing me to communicate ideas more clearly and manage responsibilities more confidently.

By reflecting on my experiences and aligning them with my long-term career goals, I have developed a clearer sense of direction for my trajectory in research and data-focused roles. This process has reinforced the importance of continual self-assessment and proactive development, showing me that professional growth is an ongoing journey that complements technical and academic achievement.

The final unit introduced project management principles and their application to academic research. Frameworks such as Scrum and Kanban, though often associated with industry, proved highly relevant in structuring my individual project. I organised my work into sprints, defined deliverables, and tracked progress using Gantt charts.

Developing a six-month research plan with milestones and contingency strategies was essential for ensuring the feasibility of my proposal. Applying these principles not only improved my efficiency but also aligned my work with professional standards, bridging the gap between academia and industry.
