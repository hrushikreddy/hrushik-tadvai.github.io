The course provided an in-depth engagement with the concept of scientific investigation, placing particular emphasis on observation, hypothesis formation, and empirical testing. This framework gave me a strong grounding in the research cycle and helped me understand that research is not merely about executing methods, but about approaching problems with curiosity, scepticism, and a commitment to rigorous reasoning. I came to appreciate that scientific reasoning—whether deductive or inductive—is the foundation upon which credible and reliable conclusions are built, guiding every stage of inquiry from problem definition to interpretation of results.

Equally significant was the emphasis on the ethical dimensions of research. The module highlighted that ethics is not an optional consideration, but a guiding principle, especially in contexts involving human participants, sensitive data, or decision-making algorithms. Case studies exploring biased algorithms, data misuse, and the consequences of unethical practices underscored that even technically robust research can be fundamentally undermined if conducted without ethical awareness. This dual focus on scientific reasoning and ethical reflection has reshaped how I view my role as a researcher. I am not simply a technician applying methods, but a steward of knowledge and responsibility, accountable for the integrity, relevance, and impact of my work.
