Early in the module, we explored the foundations of research design. At first, I underestimated the importance of carefully structuring a project before touching any data. My instinct was always to “dive straight in” and start coding. However, through our seminars and assignments, I came to appreciate that a poorly framed question inevitably leads to inconclusive or even misleading results.

One of the module's most challenging but rewarding aspects was narrowing down a research focus and formulating effective research questions. Crafting a clear, concise proposal required a deep dive into the existing literature to identify gaps and justify the study's value. I explored various interdisciplinary sources, including research on generative adversarial networks (GANs), vision transformers (ViTs), and agricultural applications of deep learning.

This phase was particularly illuminating, as it taught me that the literature review is more than just a summary—it is a tool for critical analysis. I had to distinguish between high-impact and peripheral research, assess methodologies, and understand trends in computer vision and agritech. More importantly, I learned to refine my research scope by eliminating unnecessary variables and focusing on a specific, testable objective.

For example, I initially framed a broad question such as “How can machine learning improve agricultural productivity?” — an exciting but unmanageable starting point. Through iterative refinement, I shaped it into a more specific question like “To what extent can a vision transformer model outperform a convolutional neural network in detecting crop diseases from leaf images?” That shift taught me that specificity is not restrictive; it is liberating, because it gives clarity to methods and outcomes.
