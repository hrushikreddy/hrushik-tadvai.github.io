One of the module's most challenging but rewarding aspects was narrowing down a research focus and formulating effective research questions. Crafting a clear, concise proposal required a deep dive into the existing literature to identify gaps and justify the study's value. I explored various interdisciplinary sources, including research on generative adversarial networks (GANs), vision transformers (ViTs), and agricultural applications of deep learning.

This phase was particularly illuminating, as it taught me that the literature review is more than just a summary—it is a tool for critical analysis. I had to distinguish between high-impact and peripheral research, assess methodologies, and understand trends in computer vision and agritech. More importantly, I learned to refine my research scope by eliminating unnecessary variables and focusing on a specific, testable objective.
