This unit significantly strengthened my confidence in quantitative analysis. I gained hands-on experience with a range of techniques, including hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and ANOVA, which together provided a robust framework for evaluating the statistical significance of my models’ performance metrics. Working with these methods helped me understand how to assess patterns in data rigorously and interpret results in a meaningful way.

By the end of the unit, I was able to draw insightful conclusions from data sets and organise them into a structured performance evaluation framework. This framework became a central part of my project proposal, ensuring that claims about the effectiveness of my deep learning model were supported by solid statistical evidence rather than anecdotal observation.

Some examples of my statistical work from Units 8 and 9 can be viewed in my GitHub repository, which demonstrates how these quantitative skills have been applied in practice.
