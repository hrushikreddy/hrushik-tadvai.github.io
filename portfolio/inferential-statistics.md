This unit was a turning point in building my confidence in data analysis. I practiced techniques ranging from hypothesis testing to regression analysis and analysis of variance (ANOVA). These methods were crucial for interpreting the statistical significance of the model's performance metrics.

By the end of this unit, I could comfortably analyze and conclude from data sets. This empowered me to create a performance evaluation framework for my research proposal, which could rigorously assess the deep learning model's efficacy in identifying different plant species.
