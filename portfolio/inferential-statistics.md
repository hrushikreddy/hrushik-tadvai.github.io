This unit significantly strengthened my confidence in quantitative analysis. I gained hands-on experience with a range of techniques, including hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and ANOVA, which together provided a robust framework for evaluating the statistical significance of my models’ performance metrics. Working with these methods helped me understand how to assess patterns in data rigorously and interpret results in a meaningful way.

By the end of the unit, I was able to draw insightful conclusions from data sets and organise them into a structured performance evaluation framework. This framework became a central part of my project proposal, ensuring that claims about the effectiveness of my deep learning model were supported by solid statistical evidence rather than anecdotal observation.
