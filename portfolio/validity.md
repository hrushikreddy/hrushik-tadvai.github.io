# Unit 9 Reflection: Validity, Generalisability and Reliability

In Unit 9, I explored three fundamental concepts that shape how research is designed, conducted, and interpreted: **validity**, **generalisability**, and **reliability**. Engaging with these ideas helped me reflect on the importance of designing research that is both methodologically sound and capable of producing trustworthy conclusions.

A key insight for me was understanding the distinction between reliability and validity. Reliability concerns the consistency of the measurement process, while validity questions whether the approach is measuring what it is supposed to measure. I also recognised that reliability must come first—without consistent measurement, validity cannot be established. This reinforced how critical it is to plan data collection methods carefully before any data is gathered.

The unit also encouraged me to reflect on the differences between qualitative and quantitative data, not just in how they are collected but also how they should be analysed and presented. I now better appreciate why data cleaning, validation, and preparation are essential steps before applying statistical or thematic analysis.

Overall, this unit strengthened my ability to evaluate the soundness of research approaches. I feel more confident in assessing whether my methods will produce meaningful and interpretable results, and how the quality of my data directly affects the conclusions I will be able to draw in future projects.

Some examples of my statistical work from Units 8 and 9 can be viewed in my GitHub repository, which demonstrates how these quantitative skills have been applied in practice.
