From ethical principles to statistical analysis, project planning, and reflective practice, every aspect of the course contributed to the successful Development of my research proposal, "Implementing Deep Learning in Image Recognition of Plants."

These experiences have laid a solid foundation for future scholarly work and professional success in research-oriented roles.
