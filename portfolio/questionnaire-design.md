This unit clarified the distinctions between surveys and questionnaires, highlighting the specific roles each plays in research design. Even though my current project did not involve direct human participation, the theoretical grounding in questionnaire design proved highly valuable. I now have a much stronger understanding of how to structure questions, choose appropriate response formats, and phrase items in a way that is both clear and effective. The unit also emphasised the importance of aligning the design of these instruments with the objectives of the research, ensuring that the data collected is relevant, meaningful, and capable of answering the research questions.

This knowledge will be particularly useful for future studies that involve stakeholder feedback or usability testing. I am now better prepared to design research tools that capture rich insights while minimising bias and misinterpretation, ensuring that participants’ perspectives are accurately reflected. The unit reinforced that careful planning in survey and questionnaire design is not simply a procedural step, but a critical foundation for producing reliable, valid, and actionable results. It also highlighted how thoughtful instrument design can strengthen the credibility of a study and the usefulness of its findings, particularly when research outcomes may inform real-world applications.
