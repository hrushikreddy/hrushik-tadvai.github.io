This unit clarified the distinctions between surveys and questionnaires, highlighting the specific roles each plays in research design. Even though my current project did not involve direct human participation, the theoretical grounding in questionnaire design proved highly valuable. I now have a stronger understanding of how to structure questions, select appropriate formats, and ensure that instruments are both clear and effective.

This knowledge will be particularly useful for future studies that involve stakeholder feedback or usability testing. I am now better prepared to design research tools that capture meaningful insights while minimising bias, ensuring that the data collected accurately reflects participants’ perspectives. The unit reinforced that careful planning in survey and questionnaire design is essential for producing reliable, actionable results.
